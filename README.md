# BLOODBANK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM


INTRODUCTION

● Blood bank management plays a vital role for the society.
● In this generation, it is necessary to look upon the roles of a blood donor and a blood 
receiver. 
● Usually, the blood donation camps need to classify their statistical figures in a neat and 
clean manner.
● Our management system tries to compartmentalize every aspect of donors, receivers and 
blood pack inventories which will help the data to be classified accordingly.
